# Word Guessing Game
This is a simple command-line game where the player has to guess a randomly selected word within 10 attempts. The game provides a hint about the word, and the player can guess a letter at a time. If the guessed letter is present in the word, the game reveals its position(s) in the word; otherwise, the game keeps track of the wrong guesses. The game ends if the player guesses the entire word correctly within 10 attempts or runs out of attempts.

## How to Play

1.  **Introduction**: Upon starting the game, you'll be greeted with an introduction and a hint about the word to be guessed.
2.  **Guessing**: You have 10 attempts to guess the word correctly. Input a letter to make your guess.
3.  **Feedback**: If your guessed letter is correct, it will reveal its positions in the word. If it's wrong, it'll be added to the wrong guesses list.
4.  **Win or Lose**: The game continues until you correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
